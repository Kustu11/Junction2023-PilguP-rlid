### Problem

Pixieray is prototyping glasses that can autofocus whenever you are reading or not. 
As a subproduct, a lot of data from different sensors is gathered. 
We got this data and attempted to derive value from it.

### Limitation

Pixieray is a startup, and the glasses are still in prototype phase. 
Due to this, the data is confidential and cannot be shared here, but folder structure for the data is provided. 
In case of intrest of the data, please contact Pixieray directly.

### Solution

First we tried to get blinking patterns using the Fourier transform, but the results were not promising quick enough.
Subsequently, we adopted a machine learning approach to automatically label the data with different categories. The results are looking promising, and it is definately a potential use case that can be further researched.
